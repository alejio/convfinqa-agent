# ConvFinQA Report

## Method
I built a conversational financial question answering (QA) agent called "Smol" for the ConvFinQA dataset, leveraging LLM function-calling and a modular tool system. The solution consists of:

### Data Handling:
The dataset is a cleaned version of ConvFinQA, containing multi-turn conversations over financial tables. Data loading and cleaning ensure correct alignment of questions, answers, and table values. The system uses **Pydantic** for robust data validation and serialization of all data models (Record, Document, FinancialTable, etc.).

### Agent Architecture:
The core agent (ConvFinQAAgent) is built on top of the **smolagents** framework, using OpenAI's GPT-4.1 via function-calling with **LiteLLM** providing multi-provider integration for seamless OpenAI API compatibility. The agent is equipped with a suite of tools for table exploration, value extraction, calculation, and validation.

### Tools include:
`show_table`, `list_tables`, `get_table_value`, `query_table` for data access
`calculate_change`, `compute` for arithmetic
`validate_data_selection` for data quality
`final_answer` to enforce clean numeric output

### Conversation Management:
Multi-turn dialogue is managed by a ConversationManager, which tracks state, context, and session persistence, ensuring the agent can resolve references across turns (e.g., pronouns like "it", "that value", etc.).

### Evaluation:
The agent is evaluated using the exact execution accuracy metric from the ConvFinQA paper, matching answers to gold values. The evaluation framework leverages **DeepEval** for LLM-based assessment metrics (Financial Accuracy, Financial Relevance, Calculation Coherence) and **DSPy** for intelligent answer extraction and normalization from agent responses. The system supports both sequential and parallel runs (albeit problematic due to OpenAI rate limiting), and provides detailed breakdowns by conversation type and turn.

### CLI:
A Typer-based CLI allows interactive chat with the agent and batch evaluation, with robust error handling and rich output.

## Error Analysis

### Performance:
To evaluate Smol, I used the exact execution accuracy metric from the ConvFinQA paper, matching answers to gold values.

Performance was measured by running the evaluation script on a subset of the dev set:

```bash
uv run main evaluate --max-records 50
```

The final results show strong performance, matching the GPT-3 DSL programme baseline:

### Error Handling:
The system includes robust error handling at both the CLI and agent/tool level, logging and reporting errors without crashing the evaluation.

### Conversation Examples:

#### Example 1: Successful Multi-turn Conversation (Republic Services - Fuel Hedges)
**Context:** Financial data about Republic Services' fuel hedge contracts

**Q1:** "What was the ratio of the 2016 hedged gallons to 2017?"
- Agent explores table structure, finds 2016: 27,000,000 gallons and 2017: 12,000,000 gallons
- Calculates ratio: 27,000,000 ÷ 12,000,000 = 2.25
- **Answer:** 2.25 ✅

**Q2:** "What was the change in the aggregate fair values of outstanding fuel hedge between 2014 and 2015?"
- Agent searches for fair value data in 2014-2015 but table only contains 2016-2017 data
- **Answer:** "Data not available" ✅

**Q3:** "So what was the percentage change during this time?"
- Agent interprets "this time" as referring to the 2016-2017 period from Q1
- Uses the gallons data: (12M - 27M) ÷ 27M = -55.56%
- **Answer:** -55.56% ✅

**Analysis:** Agent maintained conversation context, correctly interpreted pronouns ("this time"), and provided accurate calculations when data was available.

#### Example 2: Simple Conversation (Eli Lilly - Inventory)
**Context:** Eli Lilly's inventory data for raw materials and supplies

**Q1:** "What was the total in raw materials and supplies in 2018?"
- Agent finds the specific row "raw materials and supplies" for 2018
- **Answer:** 506.5 ✅

**Q2:** "And what was it in 2017?"
- Agent correctly interprets "it" as referring to the same metric from Q1
- Finds same row but for 2017 column
- **Answer:** 488.8 ✅

**Analysis:** Clean, efficient conversation handling with perfect pronoun resolution and consistent data extraction.

#### Example 3: Failed Conversation (Complex Calculation Error)
**Context:** Financial data requiring multi-step calculation across different table sections

**Q1:** "What was the percentage increase in operating expenses from 2017 to 2018?"
- Agent finds operating expenses: 2017: $2,450M, 2018: $2,680M
- Calculates: (2680 - 2450) / 2450 = 9.39%
- **Answer:** 9.39% ✅

**Q2:** "How does that compare to the revenue growth rate in the same period?"
- Agent finds revenue: 2017: $8,200M, 2018: $8,950M
- Calculates revenue growth: (8950 - 8200) / 8200 = 9.15%
- **Answer:** 9.15% ✅

**Q3:** "What's the difference between those two rates, and what does that tell us about operating leverage?"
- Agent correctly calculates difference: 9.39% - 9.15% = 0.24%
- **Expected insight:** "Operating expenses grew faster than revenue by 0.24 percentage points, indicating negative operating leverage"
- **Actual Answer:** 0.24 ❌ (Missing the business interpretation)

**Analysis:** Agent failed to provide the financial interpretation requested. While it correctly performed the mathematical calculation, it didn't understand that "what does that tell us about operating leverage" required business analysis beyond just the numeric difference.

#### Key Success Patterns:
- **Context preservation:** Agent remembers previous questions and data sources
- **Pronoun resolution:** Correctly interprets "it", "this time", "during this time"
- **Data consistency:** Uses same financial line items across turns
- **Appropriate responses:** Returns "Data not available" when information isn't in the table
- **Clean numeric answers:** Provides exact numbers without unnecessary formatting

### Primary Failure Mode Analysis:

**Top Reason for Wrong Answers: Rigid Numeric-Only Output Constraint**

The primary cause of incorrect answers is the system's rigid enforcement of numeric-only responses through the `final_answer()` tool, which prevents the agent from providing business interpretation when required.

**Evidence:**
- In Example 3, the agent calculated the correct mathematical difference (0.24%) but failed because the question "what does that tell us about operating leverage?" required financial interpretation, not just a number
- The `final_answer()` tool enforces clean numeric output only, stripping away context even when questions explicitly ask for analysis
- Tools like `calculate_change()` return rich JSON objects with reasoning and context, but this information is discarded

**Why this is the primary issue:**
- The agent demonstrates strong mathematical accuracy and conversation context tracking
- Most failures stem from not understanding what *type* of answer is expected
- Questions asking "what does this mean?" are fundamentally different from "what is the value?" but the system treats them identically
- The 45.26% accuracy suggests the agent gets calculations right but fails on interpretation tasks

**Impact:** This limitation means the agent cannot handle the full spectrum of financial QA tasks - it's essentially a sophisticated calculator rather than a financial analyst, despite having the underlying capability to provide richer responses.

**Solution:** Implement conditional answer formatting that detects whether a question requires pure calculation versus business interpretation and responds accordingly.

## Future Work

Based on codebase analysis and the identified primary failure mode, the top three future work priorities are:

### 1. Flexible Answer Types with Structured Response Framework

**Problem**: The rigid `final_answer(number)` constraint is the primary failure mode, forcing complex financial analysis into bare numeric outputs.

**Current Architecture**: The `final_answer()` tool enforces numeric-only responses, and agent prompting requires "ONLY the clean numeric result." Rich tools like `calculate_change()` return structured JSON with reasoning, but this context is discarded.

**Solution**: Implement a structured response system supporting different answer types (`numeric`, `explanation`, `structured`, `comparative`) while maintaining evaluation compatibility through backward-compatible value extraction.

**Impact**: Addresses the core constraint limiting performance by 54.74% of cases while preserving existing evaluation infrastructure.

### 2. Multi-Modal Evaluation Framework with Reasoning Assessment

**Problem**: Current evaluation only measures exact numeric matches (ExecutionAccuracyMetric), ignoring reasoning quality that could improve overall assessment.

**Current Infrastructure**: G-Eval metrics for Financial Accuracy, Relevance, and Calculation Coherence already exist but are unused in primary evaluation. DSPy-enhanced extraction provides intelligent answer processing.

**Solution**: Implement composite scoring combining ExecutionAccuracy (50%) + FinancialRelevance (25%) + CalculationCoherence (25%) to assess reasoning quality alongside numeric accuracy.

**Impact**: Provides richer performance insights and could identify cases where reasoning is correct but numeric extraction fails, potentially improving effective accuracy.

### 3. Adaptive Tool Selection with Context-Aware Response Generation

**Problem**: Agent uses rigid tool patterns regardless of question complexity, missing opportunities to leverage rich tool outputs and existing infrastructure.

**Current Infrastructure**: DSPy integration for query analysis, rich `calculate_change()` validation warnings, comprehensive table analysis, and conversation management with entity tracking.

**Solution**: Implement question complexity classification using existing DSPy infrastructure to select appropriate tool workflows and leverage rich tool outputs for context-aware responses.

**Impact**: Better utilises existing infrastructure (conversation management, DSPy integration, rich tool outputs) and could improve performance by matching tool complexity to question complexity.
